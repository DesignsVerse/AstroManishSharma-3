              "The origin of Maa Baglamukhi is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology, particularly within the Tantric traditions of the Mahavidyas. According to ancient scriptures, Maa Baglamukhi emerged during a cosmic crisis when a great storm threatened to destroy the universe. Lord Vishnu, seeking to restore balance, invoked the supreme Shakti, who manifested as Maa Baglamukhi to subdue the chaos. Known as the ‘Stambhini’ (the one who stuns or paralyzes), Maa Baglamukhi is depicted holding the tongue of adversaries, symbolizing her power to control negative forces. Baglamukhi Pandit Manish Sharma notes that this mythological narrative underscores the temple’s purpose as a sanctuary for overcoming obstacles. The Maa Baglamukhi Mandir in Nalkheda is believed to be a physical manifestation of this divine energy, where devotees perform the Best Maa Baglamukhi Puja to harness Maa’s transformative power. The temple’s historical connection to this mythology enhances its spiritual aura, making it a sacred destination for Tantric practices.",
